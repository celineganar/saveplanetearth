# SavePlanetEarthInfo
Project Scope: Trinidad and Tobago has a significant garbage problem. Litter is widespread on this island. Disposables and other waste can be found along roadsides, in drains and even on beaches. In 2018, over a half-a-ton of garbage was removed from Invaders Bay, Port-of-Spain. Littering reveals the lack of environmental consciousness the society has. As such, Save Planet Earth aims to promote awareness to the citizens of T&T about the impact they have on the environment in a fun and creative way. 

Project Description:
Save Planet Earth will be a platform where users can host and be informed of eco-events such as Beach Clean Ups, Planting Trees Events etc. There would be an informative section where users can learn more about the impact they have on the environment, recycling and reducing the amount of waste they produce. The application would encourage users to carpool with those in their community and reduce their carbon emissions daily. In addition, it will allow users to track the amount of footsteps they make where they can be self rewarded with a healthier lifestyle as well as gain points on the application. This will be a challenge feature where users can participate in green missions where they are rewarded with points. This will be displayed on a chart where users would be able to track their monthly progress of their eco-friendly lifestyle. At the end of the month, the user with the highest number of points would be given a badge to display on their profile. They would also be rewarded vouchers and gift certificates from companies and which in return, will gain advertisement on the application. Lastly, there will also be a page dedicated to contact information of various recycling facilities such as iCareTT and other garbage collectors as well as information on environment conservation and protection.
